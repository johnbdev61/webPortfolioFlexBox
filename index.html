            <h2>Hi! I'm John Byrne</h2>
              <p>I am a former technical sales representative living in Chicago, Illinois. As I continue my journey through Thinkful, I will update this page with projects that I have worked on and skills that I have developed. Hopefully by the end of this course I will have proved myself as a worthy addition to your company. I believe that my current professional skillset in outside sales will be a perfect marriage with my new skills in software development.</p>        
            <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p>I have always been passionate about technology and computers. In my career as an outside sales rep I worked with a diverse team to engineer fully automated control systems. Outside of coding, I enjoy playing guitar and discussing film.</p>
